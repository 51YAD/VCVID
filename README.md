# tgvc-video-tests

Just for testing video streaming using pytgcalls

## Deploy

It's better to figure it by yourself, 
The command is `python -m vcbot` btw :)

## Before running

- install latest pyrogram

`pip uninstall pyrogram && pip install git+https://github.com/pyrogram/pyrogram@master`


- install pytgcalls dev version

`pip install -U pytgcalls==3.0.0.dev9`


Made with [pytgcalls](https://github.com/MarshalX/tgcalls) and [pyrogram](https://github.com/pyrogram/pyrogram) ❤️
